It may be changed over the lifetime of the component in response to user action or system event. It is the heart of the react component which determines the behavior of the component and how it will render."},{id:2,question:"What is Props?",answer:'Props stand for "Properties" in React. It gives a way to pass data from the parent to the child components throughout the application.'},{id:3,question:"What are the components in React?",answer:"Components are the building blocks of any React application, and a single app usually consists of multiple components. A component is essentially a piece of the user interface. It splits the user interface into independent, reusable parts that can be processed separately."},{id:4,question:"What is an event in React?",answer:"An event is an action which triggers as a result of the user action or system generated event like a mouse click, loading of a web page, pressing a key, window resizes, etc. In React, the event handling system is very similar to handling events in DOM elements."},{id:5,question:"What are Lists in React?",answer:"Lists are used to display data in an ordered format. In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create it in JavaScript. We can traverse the elements of the list using the map() function."},{id:6,question:"What is the significance of keys in React?",answer:"A key is a unique identifier. In React, it is used to identify which items have changed, updated, or deleted from the Lists. It is useful when we dynamically created components or when the users alter the lists. It also helps to determine which components in a collection needs to be re-rendered instead of re-rendering the entire set of components every time. It increases application performance."},{id:7,question:"What is virtual DOM?",answer:"DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM represents an HTML document with a logical tree structure. Each branch of the tree ends in a node, and each node contains objects."},{id:8,question:"What are fragments?",answer:"In was introduced in React 16.2 version. In React, Fragments are used for components to return multiple elements. It allows you to group a list of multiple children without adding an extra node to the DOM."}],d=(n(10),n(0));var l=function(e){var t=e.question,n=e.answer,s=Object(a.useState)(!1),i=Object(c.a)(s,2),r=i[0],o=i[1];return Object(d.jsxs)(d.Fragment,{children:[Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"content",children:[Object(d.jsxs)("p",{onClick:function(){return o(!r)},children:[" ",r?"\u2796":"\u2795"]}),Object(d.jsx)("h1",{children:t})]}),r&&Object(d.jsx)("p",{className:"ans",children:n})]})};var u=function(){var e=Object(a.useState)(h),t=Object(c.a)(e,2),n=t[0];return t[1],Object(d.jsx)(d.Fragment,{children:Object(d.jsxs)("div",{className:"container",children:[Object(d.jsx)("h1",{children:"React Interview Questions"}),n.map((function(e){var t=e.id;return Object(d.jsx)(l,Object(o.a)({},e),t)}))]})})};var p=function(){return Object(d.jsx)(d.Fragment,{children:Object(d.jsx)(u,{})})};r.a.render(Object(d.jsx)(s.a.StrictMode,{children:Object(d.jsx)(p,{})}),document.getElementById("root"))}},[[12,1,2]]]);
